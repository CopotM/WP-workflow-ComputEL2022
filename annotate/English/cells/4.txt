Do museum labels have an impact on,how,True,people look at artworks ?
"Thus , the time",it,True,"takes and the ways of visually exploring an artwork can inform about its relevance , interestingness , and even its aesthetic appeal ."
Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts ( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman,et,True,"al. , 2005 ) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit ( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) ."
"In this study we used eye-tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham , of which the 13 Zurbarán artworks ( there are actually only 12 Zurbarán artworks , the 13th Benjamin , is a copy by Arthur Pond ) are a key part of , to investigate the ways in which audiences look at Spanish art ,",how,True,aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways .
This pilot project primarily investigated,how,True,"participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit , namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour ."
"Measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce , particularly in a rapidly expanding field like computer science , is a crucial first step toward understanding",how,True,scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced .
"For many scientific fields , however , there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty , making",it,True,difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis .
"Second , aggregate information provides only a high-level view of a field , which can make",it,True,difficult to investigate causality [ 23 ] .
"This system is efficient and accurate , and",it,True,can be adapted to any academic discipline and used for continuous collection .
This system can also be used longitudinally to study,how,True,"the workforce’s workforce ’s composition changes over time , which is particularly valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of policies meant to broaden participation or improve retention of faculty ."
The first demonstrates the validity and utility of the crawler by collecting census data for the field of computer science and comparing,it,True,"to a hand-curated census , collected in 2011 [ 19 ] ."
"Given that need , we have developed software , based on Natural Language Processing , that automatically identifies enjambment in Spanish , and applied",it,True,"to a corpus of approx. 3750 sonnets by ca. 1000 authors , from the 15th to the 19th century ."
"Such an organization is surely permissible , but",it,True,has had the unfortunate ( and likely intended ) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large .
"Thus , when ACPeds issued a statement condemning gender reassignment surgery in 2016 [ 21 ] , many people mistook the organization’s organization ’s political beliefs for the consensus view among United States pediatricians — although the",peak,True,"body for pediatric workers , the American Academy of Pediatrics , has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [ 22 ] ."
"Insofar as the larger organization , with a broader membership base , can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise ,",it,True,is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization .
When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that,it,True,"speaks for the profession , it introduces an epistemic pollutant ."
The controversy surrounding Beall’s Beall ’s decision indicates,how,True,difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals .
"Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise ,",it,True,is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions .
"The attention is the main point made in this study , since",it,True,is fundamental to the learning process and be recurring complaint among parents and teachers in schools .
"Other studies specifically investigate the use of digital games in the school context and suggest potential for digital game use to improve of student's student 's attention span at preschool age ( Rueda , Checa , & Cómbita , 2012 ) , to improve overall intelligence capacity of elementary school children ( Miller & Robertson , 2010 ) , and to better performance of working memory ability ( Klingberg",et,True,"al. , 2005 ; Thorell , Lindqvist , Nutley , Bohlin , & Klingberg , 2009 ) ."
"Thus ,",it,True,suggests the use of digital games in an integrated way the school activities in the classroom .
But,it,True,is not that a word can have just any vocal sound .
We show that the form is locally calibrated in ways that show,it,True,fitting within different language systems .
"Huh ? may be a non-prototypical word , but",it,True,is a word .
"repair is initiated not by the speaker of the first turn but by the other participant ( “ other-initiated ” ) , and the repair initiator signals that there is a problem , but",it,True,leaves open what the problem is ( “ open ” ) [ 11 ] .
These examples show that,it,True,is possible to identify the same conversational structure in unrelated languages .
"In some languages the interjection , or an item similar to",it,True,", was also found in other sequential environments , for instance to mark surprise or to pursue a response ."
"On the surface ,",it,True,"does seem as if there is variability and perhaps a larger sample size or more items could lead to a significant finding ( see limitations below ) , but at least for this study , the only significant finding was the difference between cardinal numbers and some ."
"In a future study ,",it,True,"is also important to consider if additional training in the difference between reporting on felicity and truth value judgments would impact results , or if more naturalistic experimental conditions ( e.g. , demonstrating actions using real objects instead of two-dimensional depictions ) would be beneficial ."
"however , in the study by Hein and colleagues",it,True,was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type .
"Upon arrival at the school , however ,",it,True,became clear that the children were not accustomed to playing with puppets and that the data collection would be a novel experience for them .

"Enjambment takes place when a syntactic unit is broken up across two lines of poetry ( Domínguez Caparrós , 2000 : 103 ) , giving rise to different stylistic effects ( e.g.",increased,False,"emphasis on elements of the broken-up phrase , or contrast between those elements ) , or creating double interpretations for the enjambed lines ( García-Paje , 1991 ) ."
