,We are aware of six studies,designed,True,"to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] , all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral ( performance ) outcomes ."
,The six studies,tested,True,"L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] or lexical abilities [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ."
,"Across the studies , the periods of limited exposure",followed,True,"either classroom training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] or mixed classroom and immersion training [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] ."

,"In 2015 , an initiative was",started,True,"to set up a Dutch speaking DH+Lib community in the Netherlands and Belgium , based on the example of the American communal space of librarians , archivists , LIS graduate students , and information specialists to discuss topics ‘ Where the Digital Humanities and Libraries meet ’ ."
,"A year later , the National Library of the Netherlands ( Koninklijke Bibliotheek ) , and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who",wanted,True,to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field .
,Therefore both institutes,joined,True,forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians .
,The two institutes were later,joined,True,by the Leiden University Libraries .
,"In essence , we want to teach our country’s country ’s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner",needed,True,in DH projects .
,"Identify possible subjects ,",based,True,"on experience , a comparison of existing teaching material related to DH ( e.g. The Programming Historian , the Digital Scholarship Training Programme at the British Library and Columbia University's University 's Developing Librarian project ) and the TaDiRAH taxonomy of research activities ;"
,"Get feedback from researchers on possible subjects ,",based,True,on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need ;
,"Get feedback from librarians on possible subjects ,",based,True,on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills .
,"With these in hand , we will design the curriculum of clinics ,",based,True,"on the method of ' constructive alignment ' ( Biggs et al. , 2011 ) , to make sure that the intended learning objectives and the teaching / learning activities stay aligned ."
,"Each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers , that address the conceptual knowledge",needed,True,.
,"The poster at DH2017 will present the curriculum , its position in the international context and offer the lessons",learned,True,from both the design process and the first clinics .
,"In 1801 , he was sent to Harrow , where he",remained,True,until July 1805 . [ 6 ]
,Byron finally,returned,True,"in January 1804 , [ 6 ] to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys , which he recalled with great vividness : "" My school friendships were with me passions ( for I was always violent ) . "" [ 21 ]"
,"The following autumn , he went up to Trinity College , Cambridge , [ 24 ] where he met and",formed,True,a close friendship with the younger John Edleston .
,Also while at Cambridge he,formed,True,"lifelong friendships with men such as John Cam Hobhouse , who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club , which endorsed liberal politics , [ 28 ] and Francis Hodgson , a Fellow at King's King 's College , with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life ."
,"nevertheless , he was",treated,True,"deferentially in San Francisco , and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented ."
,Though some,considered,True,"him insane or eccentric , citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations , such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland , and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay ."
