This paper,describes,True,a collaborative pilot project focusing on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbarán paintings .
While studies of the psychology of art have focused on individual,works,True,"and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics , no work has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes ."
The project,brings,True,"together established research strengths in Spanish art history , experimental psychology , digital humanities , and museum studies to explore , using eye-tracking techniques , aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual Zurbarán artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole ."
Our experience of art,develops,True,from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes ; the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork .
"Importantly , studying eye movements",offers,True,"an insight that does not depend on the participants’ participants ’ beliefs , memories or subjective impressions of the artwork ."
"Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts ( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman et al. , 2005 ) and at the same time",offers,True,"a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit ( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) ."
This pilot project primarily investigated how participants visually explore artworks and,provides,True,"new insights into the potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit , namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour ."
"As an example , research",shows,True,"that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers ."
"But , this data set is only a single snapshot of an evolving and expanding system and hence",offers,True,few insights into the changing composition and diversity trends within these academic fields .
"Second , aggregate information",provides,True,"only a high-level view of a field , which can make it difficult to investigate causality [ 23 ] ."
This system can also be used longitudinally to study how the workforce’s workforce ’s composition,changes,True,"over time , which is particularly valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of policies meant to broaden participation or improve retention of faculty ."
Our study is organized as,follows,True,.
The second,provides,True,an example of the type of research enabled by our system and uses the 2011 and 2017 censuses to investigate the “ leaky pipeline ” problem in faculty retention .
"First , the literature",shows,True,"a debate about which specific syntactic units can be considered to trigger enjambment , if split across two lines , and whether lexical and syntactic criteria are sufficient to identify enjambment ."
Systematically collecting large amounts of enjambment examples,provides,True,"helpful evidence to assess scholars’ scholars ’ current claims , and may stimulate novel analyses ."
The project’s project ’s website,provides,True,"details omitted here for space reasons , including samples for the corpus , results , and other details ."
The project site,includes,True,"Quilis’s Quilis ’s complete list of syntactic environments that can trigger enjambment , as well as the types identified by our system ."
"To differentiate these cases from enjambment proper , Spang",calls,True,"these cases "" enlace "" , translated here as "" expansion "" ."
"The fact that these criteria are widely known , however ,",offers,True,"an opportunity to those who would use them for deception , witting or unwitting ."
We live in an epistemic environment that is heavily and deliberately polluted by agents who use mimicry and other methods as a,means,True,of inflating their pretense to expertise .
"Such an organization is surely permissible , but it has had the unfortunate ( and likely intended ) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college",speaks,True,for the pediatric profession at large .
When ACPeds,allows,True,"or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession , it introduces an epistemic pollutant ."
"For example , the Frontiers contingent of journals",appears,True,legitimate — at least to me — despite the fact that authors are expected to pay a publication fee . 8
"Cognitive games involve a number of different games working aspects of human cognition , while proposing the intersection between the",sets,True,"of concepts , fun and cognition , for the improvement of cognitive functions ."
"Thus , it",suggests,True,the use of digital games in an integrated way the school activities in the classroom .
The application,allows,True,visualization of the player's player 's performance and offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers .
The teachers observed,changes,True,"after the intervention , emphasizing the greater persistence and involvement in school activities , and in some students , improvement in the ability to sustain attention ."
"From this , we conclude that an intervention based on cognitive digital games",offers,True,contributions to the learning process and improvement of sustained attention .
It,follows,True,"from these two basic principles – the ‘ arbitrariness of the sign ’ , and the ‘ selectiveness of particular sound systems ’ – that the words that exist in the world's world 's languages should sound quite different from each other , and that the likelihood that there are universal words is extremely small ."
"In support of the second claim , we show that Huh ?",meets,True,the criteria of a word in the sense of being a conventional lexical sign which must be learnt .
"repair is initiated not by the speaker of the first turn but by the other participant ( “ other-initiated ” ) , and the repair initiator signals that there is a problem , but it",leaves,True,open what the problem is ( “ open ” ) [ 11 ] .
"The viewing experience of art is a complex one ,",involving,False,"issues of perception , attention , memory , decision-making , affect , and emotion ."
