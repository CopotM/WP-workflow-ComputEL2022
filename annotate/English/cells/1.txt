How do people,look,True,at and experience art ?
Which elements of specific artworks do they,focus,True,on ?
Do museum labels have an impact on how people,look,True,at artworks ?
"While studies of the psychology of art have focused on individual works and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics , no",work,True,has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes .
The purpose of this pilot,study,True,was to assess the effects of different written interpretation on the visual exploration of artworks .
Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we,understand,True,"visual processing in the arts ( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman et al. , 2005 ) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit ( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) ."
In this,study,True,"we used eye-tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham , of which the 13 Zurbarán artworks ( there are actually only 12 Zurbarán artworks , the 13th Benjamin , is a copy by Arthur Pond ) are a key part of , to investigate the ways in which audiences look at Spanish art , how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways ."
This pilot project primarily investigated how participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we,understand,True,"visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit , namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour ."
Tenured and tenure-track university faculty,play,True,"a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress , both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers ."
"As an example , research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can",lead,True,"to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers ."
"Additionally , diversity has been shown to",produce,True,"more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [ 4 ] , which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists ."
"Measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce , particularly in a rapidly expanding field",like,True,"computer science , is a crucial first step toward understanding how scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced ."
"Further , rates of adoption of services",like,True,"GoogleScholar and ResearchGate vary within , and across disciplines ."
"Some disciplines ,",like,True,"political science , are organized around a single professional society , whose membership roll approximates a full census [ 7 ] ."
This data,set,True,"has shed considerable light on dramatic inequalities in faculty training , placement , and scholarly productivity [ 6 , 19 , 20 ] ."
"But , this data",set,True,is only a single snapshot of an evolving and expanding system and hence offers few insights into the changing composition and diversity trends within these academic fields .
Such surveys can,provide,True,valuable insight into trends and summary statistics on the scientific workforce but suffer from two key weaknesses .
This system can also be used longitudinally to,study,True,"how the workforce’s workforce ’s composition changes over time , which is particularly valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of policies meant to broaden participation or improve retention of faculty ."
Our,study,True,is organized as follows .
We,begin,True,by detailing the design and implementation of our web crawler framework .
"Next , we present the results of our",work,True,in two sections .
Enjambment takes,place,True,"when a syntactic unit is broken up across two lines of poetry ( Domínguez Caparrós , 2000 : 103 ) , giving rise to different stylistic effects ( e.g. increased emphasis on elements of the broken-up phrase , or contrast between those elements ) , or creating double interpretations for the enjambed lines ( García-Paje , 1991 ) ."
"In Spanish poetry , the syntactic configurations under which enjambment takes",place,True,"have been described extensively , and detailed studies on the use of enjambment by individual authors exist ( see Martínez Cantón , 2011 for an overview ) including , among others Quilis ( 1964 ) , Domínguez Caparrós , ( 2000 ) , Paraíso , ( 2000 ) , Spang ( 1983 ) for a description of enjambment , and Alarcos ( 1966 ) , Senabre ( 1982 ) , Luján ( 2006 ) , Martínez Fernández ( 2010 ) for case-studies on a single author ."
"However , a larger-scale",study,True,"to identify enjambment across hundreds of authors spanning several centuries , enabling distant reading ( Moretti , 2013 ) , was not previously available ."
Given that,need,True,", we have developed software , based on Natural Language Processing , that automatically identifies enjambment in Spanish , and applied it to a corpus of approx. 3750 sonnets by ca. 1000 authors , from the 15th to the 19th century ."
"First , the literature shows a debate about which specific syntactic units can be considered to trigger enjambment , if split across two lines , and whether lexical and syntactic criteria are sufficient to",identify,True,enjambment .
"Finally , our",study,True,"complements Navarro’s Navarro ’s ( 2016 ) automatic metrical analyses of Spanish Golden Age sonnets , by covering a wider period and focusing on enjambment ."
First we,provide,True,the definition of enjambment adopted .
"In Spanish tradition , enjambment ( in Spanish , "" encabalgamiento "" ) is considered to take",place,True,"when a pause suggested by poetic form ( e.g. at the end of a line or across hemistichs ) occurs between strongly connected lexical or syntactic units , triggering an unnatural cut between those units ."
"Quilis ( 1964 ) performed poetry reading experiments , proposing that the following strongly connected elements",give,True,"rise to enjambment , should a poetic-form pause break them up :"
"Phrase-bounded enjambment : Within a phrase , breaking up sequences",like,True,""" noun + adjective "" , "" verb + adverb "" , "" auxiliary verb + main verb "" , among others ."
"The viewing experience of art is a complex one ,",involving,False,"issues of perception , attention , memory , decision-making , affect , and emotion ."
This paper describes a collaborative pilot project,focusing,False,on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbarán paintings .
We will discuss the potential implications of these techniques and our,understanding,False,of visual behaviours on museum and gallery practice .
"Importantly ,",studying,False,"eye movements offers an insight that does not depend on the participants’ participants ’ beliefs , memories or subjective impressions of the artwork ."
