,One indication of the importance of replication is found in the 50 or more calls for replication research in the field of second language ( L2 ) research alone ( see references for 50 calls and commentaries in Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information online ) : from Santos ( 1989 ) through Polio and Gass 1997 to very recent proposals for specific replication ,studies,False," , such as Vandergrift and Cross 2017 and even a book-length treatment ( Porte , 2012 ) .
