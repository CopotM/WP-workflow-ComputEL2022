X,"Additionally , we test whether any such outcomes might vary",as,True,"a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom-like and immersion-like contexts ."
X,These language,measures,True,"were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [ 21 ] , with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [ 24 ] ."
X,"Overall , the",results,True,of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following .
,A period of limited exposure generally,leads,True,"to attrition ( loss ) of L2 performance or knowledge [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] ."
X,Such,loss,True,"has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month [ 23 ] or 6 month delay [ 21 ] , as well as after 2 years [ 18 ] , though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier [ 17 ] ."
,"Although attrition may take place within the first few years , some studies suggest that it then",appears,True,"to level off , with no further losses occurring [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] ."
X,"Moreover , one study found no",changes,True,"at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [ 22 ] ."
X,"Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion",as,True,"well as classroom training [ 24 ] , and in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] ."
,It,remains,True,"unclear what might explain such gains , which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [ 24 ] , or to factors related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training [ 18 ] ."
X,We see this,as,True,"the ideal opportunity to provide these educative sessions not only to our own librarians , but also to the academic librarians of other Dutch research libraries ."
,Each day,starts,True,"with one or more lectures by researchers , that address the conceptual knowledge needed ."
X,"The afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills , following the Library Carpentry model",as,True,closely as possible .
X,Byron received,his,True,"early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School , and in August 1799 entered the school of Dr. William Glennie , in Dulwich . [ 17 ]"
X,"Placed under the care of a Dr. Bailey , he was encouraged to exercise in moderation but not restrain himself from "" violent "" bouts in an attempt to overcompensate for",his,True,deformed foot .
X,His mother interfered with,his,True,"studies , often withdrawing him from school , with the result that he lacked discipline and his classical studies were neglected ."
X,"In Byron's Byron 's later memoirs , "" Mary Chaworth is portrayed",as,True,"the first object of his adult sexual feelings . "" [ 20 ]"
X,His nostalgic poems about,his,True,"Harrow friendships , Childish Recollections ( 1806 ) , express a prescient "" consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him . "" [ 23 ]"
