X,"Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month [ 23 ] or 6 month delay [ 21 ] , as well as after 2 years [ 18 ] , though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years ,",and,True,not earlier [ 17 ] .
X,"Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [ 24 ] ,",and,True,"in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] ."
