,"These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [ 21 ] , with only one longitudinal study",testing,True,the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [ 24 ] .

x,At the initial,meeting,True,it became apparent that most participants were there to learn more about digital humanities and were not ( yet ) in the situation where they were able to offer expertise on the subject .
,"In essence , we want to teach our country’s country ’s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and",supporting,True,research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects .
,"The content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students , identify",remaining,True,gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and ( perhaps ) to automate their daily library work .
,"We are not setting out to turn them into programmers or data crunchers , but want to boost their knowledge level to where they feel comfortable",providing,True,"information about DH projects , follow the literature and research , follow online tutorials and hopefully take up the challenge of finishing this professional development by engaging with the DH community ."

,"Identify possible subjects , based on experience , a comparison of",existing,True,"teaching material related to DH ( e.g. The Programming Historian , the Digital Scholarship Training Programme at the British Library and Columbia University's University 's Developing Librarian project ) and the TaDiRAH taxonomy of research activities ;"
,"With these in hand , we will design the curriculum of clinics , based on the method of ' constructive alignment ' ( Biggs et al. , 2011 ) , to make sure that the intended",learning,True,objectives and the teaching / learning activities stay aligned .
,"The afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills ,",following,True,the Library Carpentry model as closely as possible .
,"With these clinics , we hope to initiate a stream of DH activities in Dutch universities ,",making,True,access to support easier for new digital scholars .
