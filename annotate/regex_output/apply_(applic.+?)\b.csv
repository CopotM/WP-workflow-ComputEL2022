The sample consisted of 71 students of the ,Application," School of Basic Education , Federal University of Santa Catarina , aged 7 and 9 years old ( M = 7.64 ± 1.12 ) , which were divided into two groups : participant and control . 
"
The ,application," allows visualization of the player's player 's performance and offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers . 
"
A statistical analysis was performed based on the ,application," of the paired t-test on the difference of the overall score obtained in the test before and after the intervention in the two groups . 
"
The difference in the results obtained from the ,application," of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) ,

"We describe the process for applying the operators and generating mutants , and present a case study where these mutation operators are applied to two real-world ",applications," . 
"
The different mutants are generated automatically by the ,application," of mutation operators . 
"
"In this article , we propose mutation operators specific to the domain of Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) ",applications," . 
"
These operators reproduce programming errors that are litely to occur during the development of this type of ,applications," . 
"
"In addition , we present the implementation of these operators and as proof of concept we apply these operators to two real-world GIS ",applications," and we generate the mutants . 
"
"Next , we describe the definition of two operators and two cases of ",application, on real-world GIS ,"s . 
"
This operator was applied to a mobile technology GIS ,application," . 
"
This ,application," allows registering places of interest for the user . 
"
"As a result , the user will see in the ",application,’s ," ’s map viewer the Geofences drawn in erroneous zones ( Figure 1 ) .

Figure 1 . Original and mutant ,application," . 
"
In this ,application," , the result of the operation between two polygons has been affected . 
"
Figure 2 . Original and mutant ,application," . 
"
"In addition , we have tested the operators defined in two GIS ",applications," . 
"
"Future research should explore the negotiation tactics observed in transmedia fans using the principles of De Certeau’s Certeau ’s ( 1984 ) everyday life practice , in order to extend its ",application," to the broader context of modern-day consumers . 
"
He is particularly remembered for his ,applications," of mathematics to mechanics , especially fluid mechanics , and for his pioneering work in probability and statistics . 
"
The central idea is to first apply rules to the smallest ,applicable," unit , then apply to the smallest unit containing that one , and so on . [ 5 ]
