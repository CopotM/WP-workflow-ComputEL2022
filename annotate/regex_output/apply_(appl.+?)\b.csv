"Finally , ",applied," to many academic fields in parallel , the system can elucidate scientists’ scientists ’ movement between different disciplines and relate those labor flows to scientific advances . 
"
"Given that need , we have developed software , based on Natural Language Processing , that automatically identifies enjambment in Spanish , and ",applied," it to a corpus of approx. 3750 sonnets by ca. 1000 authors , from the 15th to the 19th century . 
"
The sample consisted of 71 students of the ,Application," School of Basic Education , Federal University of Santa Catarina , aged 7 and 9 years old ( M = 7.64 ± 1.12 ) , which were divided into two groups : participant and control . 
"
The ,application," allows visualization of the player's player 's performance and offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers . 
"
A statistical analysis was performed based on the ,application," of the paired t-test on the difference of the overall score obtained in the test before and after the intervention in the two groups . 
"
The difference in the results obtained from the ,application," of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) , 
"
"It is often grouped depending on its uses that are distributed for heating and cooling , lighting , operating ",appliances," etc [ 1 ] 
"
We describe the process for ,applying," the operators and generating mutants , and present a case study where these mutation operators are applied to two real-world applications . 
"
The different mutants are generated automatically by the ,application," of mutation operators . 
"
"In this article , we propose mutation operators specific to the domain of Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) ",applications," . 
"
These operators reproduce programming errors that are litely to occur during the development of this type of ,applications," . 
"
"In addition , we present the implementation of these operators and as proof of concept we ",apply," these operators to two real-world GIS applications and we generate the mutants . 
"
In order to ,apply," these operators to a SUT , we rely on Java reflection and aspect-oriented programming . 
"
"Reflection allows us to obtain the list of classes and methods of the SUT , so the user can decide the methods to wish the operators will be ",applied," . 
"
"Next , we describe the definition of two operators and two cases of ",application, on real-world GIS ,"s . 
"
This operator was ,applied," to a mobile technology GIS application . 
"
This ,application," allows registering places of interest for the user . 
"
"As a result , the user will see in the ",application,’s ," ’s map viewer the Geofences drawn in erroneous zones ( Figure 1 ) . 
"
Figure 1 . Original and mutant ,application," . 
"
To test this operator it was ,applied," to a land reparcelling system .
