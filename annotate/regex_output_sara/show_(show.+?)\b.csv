x,"As an example , research ",shows,False," that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers . 
",
x,"Additionally , diversity has been ",shown,False," to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [ 4 ] , which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists . 
",
x,"First , the literature ",shows,False," a debate about which specific syntactic units can be considered to trigger enjambment , if split across two lines , and whether lexical and syntactic criteria are sufficient to identify enjambment . 
",
x,"In support of the first claim , we ",show ,False,"that the similarities in form and function of an interjection with the specific function of repair initiation are very much greater across languages than chance coincidence would admit . 
",
x,"In support of the second claim , we ",show ,False,"that Huh ? meets the criteria of a word in the sense of being a conventional lexical sign which must be learnt . 
",
x,We ,show ,False,that the form is locally calibrated in ways that ,"it fitting within different language systems . 
"
x,Extracts 2 and 3 ,show ,False,"structurally identical sequences in two other languages : Siwu , a Kwa language spoken in Ghana , and Lao , a Tai-Kadai language spoken in Laos . 
",
x,These examples ,show ,False,"that it is possible to identify the same conversational structure in unrelated languages . 
",
x,"Sequences of other-initiated repair have been identified in every spoken language investigated so far [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , and as the examples ","show , ",False,"the interjection in the pivotal turn can be remarkably similar . 
",
x,"Now that the world is in the age where lighting seems to be a daily necessity , typical homes as ",shown,False," in figure 1 , consume nearly 27 percent of the energy used today : making lighting as the major source of electricity consumption . 
",
,Lighting plays a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy , it consumes about 18 % of the total generated electricity of total energy consumption in residential sectors as ,shown,False," in figure 2 [ 2 ] . 
"
x,We have ,shown,False," that the addition of an artificial tail during ontogeny can produce postural and locomotory changes in chickens , consistent with the posture and kinematics inferred for non-avian dinosaurs [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] . 
",
x,These postural and kinematics changes cannot can not be attributed to an increased weight as subjects of the control-weight group did not ,show ,False,"the same changes as the experimental group . 
",
x,"In fact , the control-weight subjects ",showed,False," a more horizontally oriented femur during walking with respect to the control group , similar to that observed in Carrano and Biewener's Biewener 's experimental subjects [ 7 ] . 
",
x,Our data ,show ,False,"that for a given CFL mass , femoral retraction can be greatly affected by the location of the CoM and limb postures . 
",
x,"It has even been proposed that , due to functional convergence , mammals might be a better system to study bipedal dinosaur locomotion [ 7 ] , [ 23 ] , but the results reported here ",show ,False,"that important aspects of non-avian theropod locomotion can be experimentally recreated in modern birds . 
",
x,"One caveat , however , is that our approach uses tail reduction as the mechanism for CoM displacement despite it has been recently ",shown,False," that the evolutionary change in CoM position was driven instead by forelimb enlargement [ 8 ] . 
",
,"Readers of the book series had long anticipated and dreaded the events of the “ Red Wedding ” , while fans of the ",show ,False,"unfamiliar with Martin’s Martin ’s narrative were largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode .

,"As well as appearing in films , Goode has appeared in numerous television ",shows,False," . 
",
x,"In the video , she stated , "" I'm I 'm sick and tired of guys thinking that just because I ",showed,False," up at a club or a dance or a bar , that I want to have their genitalia touching my backside "" ; [ 12 ] [ 13 ] the video had approximately 36.2 million views as of March 2018 . [ 14 ]
