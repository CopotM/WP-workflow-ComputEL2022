# A Word-and-Paradigm Workflow for Fieldwork Annotation

This repository contains code used to develop a concordance-style annotation tool for the morphological analysis of underdescribed languages. Included is an unsupervised model adapted from SIGMORPHON 2020's Task 2 baseline used to cluster lemmas and paradigm cells from unannotated input text, as well as scripts to construct datasets for annotation and a regular expression search tool to generate additional potential examples when annotating lemmas. Data and annotated files are also available for English, Croatian, and Wao Terero.

For annotation guidelines and instructions for using the regular expression tool, please see "annotation-guidelines.pdf".
